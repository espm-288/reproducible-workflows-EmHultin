### Push to git

Push works in the terminal as "git push", but NOT in the r gui 

### Bad ways to start code

These are dumb and not reproducible. You should be using project spaces!

rm(list=ls()) 

This does not actually clean out the stuff you think it does 

setwd(blah blah blah)

This only exists on your machine. Other people who try to use this will fail and it will be your fault


## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars |> ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
